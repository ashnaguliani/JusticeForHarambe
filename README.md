Description:
The goal of this project is to design an iPhone game based on current social events relating to the assassination of a certain gorilla. This will be a simple, two-dimensional, pixelated graphics game aimed at providing endless entertainment to people suffering from boredom while simultaneously shedding light on the Justice for Harambe movement and endangered species. The game will bring a replayability feature so that beginners to advanced-harambe-ites can enjoy the software for countless hours. Although the details of the game have yet to be decided upon, the basic concept will involve using touch screen controls to move Harambe in order to avoid obstacles and collect objects. The team will use Unity as the platform for game development, as it is the most widely used and offers a large resource base.

Vision Statement:
To entertain people while getting them to think about relevant social issues.

Motivation:
Justice. Creating an enjoyable game and great awareness about endangered animals.

Risks
- Lack of hardware required to export software to desired platform (few macs within the group, while gearing final product towards iOS development)
- Lack of experience using Unity game platform
- Lack of experience with Agile methodology/ Agile tools
- Lack of experience with software development
- Lack of C# coding experience
- Potential legal trouble with Cincinnati zoo
- Potential social retribution from groups such as PETA
- Time management/available time to work on project is low for all members

Risk Mitigation Plan
- Utilize CU hardware/MAC platforms of team to create final product/iOS testing iterations, while those who lack macs will work on non-mac-necessary items
- Utilize basic online tutorials to train members who do not have experience with Unity/agile/software development.
- Utilize teacher/TA’s/classmates/friends/coworkers/etc. to assist the team where knowledge and experience lacks.
- Utilize Unity’s extensive libraries and online support to augment our C# coding skills
- If we find ourselves receiving backlash from any groups, we will listen to their complaints, and find middle ground with them, without releasing our ideology or vision for the game.
- Utilize time management tools
