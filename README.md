Description
The goal of this project is to design an iPhone game based on current social events relating to the assassination of a certain gorilla. This will be a simple, two-dimensional, pixelated graphics game aimed at providing endless entertainment to people suffering from boredom while simultaneously shedding light on the Justice for Harambe movement and endangered species. The game will bring a replayability feature so that beginners to advanced-harambe-ites can enjoy the software for countless hours. Although the details of the game have yet to be decided upon, the basic concept will involve using touch screen controls to move Harambe in order to avoid obstacles and collect objects. The team will use Unity as the platform for game development, as it is the most widely used and offers a large resource base.
