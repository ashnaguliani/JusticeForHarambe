Description:
The goal of this project is to design an iPhone game based on current social events relating to the assassination of a certain gorilla. This will be a simple, two-dimensional, pixelated graphics game aimed at providing endless entertainment to people suffering from boredom while simultaneously shedding light on the Justice for Harambe movement and endangered species. The game will bring a replayability feature so that beginners to advanced-harambe-ites can enjoy the software for countless hours. Although the details of the game have yet to be decided upon, the basic concept will involve using touch screen controls to move Harambe in order to avoid obstacles and collect objects. The team will use Unity as the platform for game development, as it is the most widely used and offers a large resource base.

Vision Statement:
To provide endless entertainment while encouraging people to consider relevant social issues.

Motivation:
The motivation behind creating this game is that there are endless possibilities for simple iPhone games that are capable of keeping people entertained for hours. One of the most effective ways for tapping into this type of simple entertainment that consumers are fond of is to base the game off of relevant current events or social issues. This game will be based off the Justice for Harambe movement, which has been a continually relevant topic in U.S. current events. The goal of this game is not to make any points about events involving Harambe, but rather to shed light on the event and encourage people to form their own opinions through the medium of an addicting iPhone game.

Risks
- Lack of hardware required to export software to desired platform (few macs within the group, while gearing final product towards iOS development)
- Lack of experience using Unity game platform
- Lack of experience with Agile methodology/ Agile tools
- Lack of experience with software development
- Lack of C# coding experience
- Potential social retribution from groups such as PETA
- Time management/available time to work on project is low for all members

Risk Mitigation Plan
- Utilize CU hardware/MAC platforms of team to create final product/iOS testing iterations, while those who lack macs will work on non-mac-necessary items
- Utilize basic online tutorials to train members who do not have experience with Unity/agile/software development.
- Utilize teacher/TA’s/classmates/friends/coworkers/etc. to assist the team where knowledge and experience lacks.
- Utilize Unity’s extensive libraries and online support to augment our C# coding skills
- If we find ourselves receiving backlash from any groups, we will listen to their complaints, and find middle ground with them, without releasing our ideology or vision for the game.
- Utilize time management tools

Version Control:  
GitHub

Software Development Methodology: 
The software development method will revolve around the Agile process. This is a good fit for the team, given that there are seven milestones in a short period of time. There will be weekly standing meetings geared toward tracking progress, working out any issues, and defining action items for the upcoming week. In addition, there will be day-to-day collaboration and updates either in person or on Slack so that everyone stays on the same page in working toward completing tasks for the week.

Collaboration Tool: 
Slack
