We will be using a SQL database through phpmyadmin to create a global leaderboard database that shows players of the app the top 50 runs
globally, based on three different stats from the game. Our tables will be named distance_board which displays the top 50 scores of all
time based on the distance ran in the game. The second table is named banana_board which displays the top 50 scores of all time based on
bananas collected in a run. The third table is named score_board which displays the top 50 scores of all time based on the overall score
received from a run, which is calculated by bananas, distance, special items within the games, etc. We will be displaying the top 50
scores in each table, so with each table containing 50 rows of data, that means we should keep track of 150 specific rows of data.
